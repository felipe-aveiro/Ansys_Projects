## Welcome to my <em>Energy Systems Modelling</em> Project repository!

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
Here you'll discover resources and find materials from an Energy Systems Modelling project made using Ansys, completed during my Mechanical Engineering academic journey.

In the realm of Energy Systems Modelling, this report ventures into simulating fluid flow scenarios using Ansys software, focusing on airflow dynamics, particularly with air. It delves into three scenarios: airflow around a room, airflow within an open-loop earth-air heat exchanger (EAHE) tube, and airflow within a room equipped with heat radiators for both heating and cooling purposes. The report outlines the simulation procedures for each scenario and presents the obtained results.

### üí° Usage
Feel free to explore the project and use the resources for your learning or reference purposes. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out to me.
